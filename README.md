## What is Pokemon Discord? (Title subject to change mostly because it's bad.)

> Pokemon Discord is a discord server that acts as an environment for pokemon catching and battling. Through commands, buttons, and prompts, users can do all the core functionalities of the mainline pokemon games, but done via a series of prompts. What makes Pokemon Discord different from the other Pokemon based discord bots is that we aim to build a game where the server itself IS the game. Each channel will act as either a town or a route, where you can chat with other players OR search and battle new pokemon. Eventually, we plan to implement challenges to overcome, such as gyms and powerful boss pokemon. Our goal is to make a discord game that mimics the main series of pokemon as closely and accurately as possible within the limitations of Discord itself.
